This Python program allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers.
It asks for the first and second number, then takes an operator as input.
Based on the operator (+, -, *, /), it performs the corresponding calculation. 
Division by zero is handled with a clear error message, and results are rounded to 3 decimal places for readability. 
If the user enters an invalid operator, it shows an error.
If you need the exact calculation remove round and, decimal value 3.
FOR EXAMPLE:
                 print(round(result, 3)) this rounds the result to 3 decimal places.
                 print(result) this will print the full decimal result.
