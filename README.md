A command-line calculator application that supports basic arithmetic operations with flexible input options (2-5 numbers per operation).
This Python program allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers.
It asks for the first and second number, then takes an operator as input.
Based on the operator (+, -, *, /), it performs the corresponding calculation. 
Division by zero is handled with a clear error message. 
If the user enters an invalid operator, it shows an error.
